## Scope
The purpose of the 1st International Workshop on Adversarial Machine Learning for Recommendation and Search (AdveRSe) is to provide the first venue in the IR community to provide a place to encourage discussion, create novel collaborations, and share research ideas mainly focused on understanding the threat of adversarial machine learning and countering this threat to achieve trustworthy search and recommendation systems.

AdveRSe 2021 is the 1st edition of the International Workshop on Adversarial Machine Learning for Recommendation and Search. It will take place **online** on November 1-1, 2021 in conjunction with [CIKM 2021](http://www.cikm2021.org/).

## Topics

AdveRSe 2021 offers an opportunity to present and discuss both theoretical and empirical research. Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:

- **Theory and algorithms for AML in search and recommendation**
  - Attacks on images, videos, audio signals, and text
  - Attacks on model parameters with gradient methods 
  - Attacks by generating of fake profiles, e.g., customer one-commerce platforms 
  - Attacks crafted with generative adversarial networks 
  - Real-world attack scenarios–Other attack techniques 
  
- **Theory and algorithms for defending with AML in search and recommendation**
    - Robust optimization methods 
    - Adversarial training strategies 
    - Robustness certification 
    - Generative adversarial networks to protect from adversarial attacks 
    - Data augmentation with adversarial training  
    - Datasets for evaluating model robustness 

- **Evaluation of Adversarial Attacks and Defences in search and recommendation**
    - Offline evaluation measures and protocols 
    - Online evaluation measures and protocols 
    - Advanced applications (Trustworthy ML) for search and recommendation 
    - Fairness 
    - Privacy 
    - Federated machine learning 
    - Explainable machine learning models 
    - Counterfactual reasoning 

## Submissions
Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM’21’s Easychair site in PDF format, using the ACM sigconf template, see [ACM Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). 

To be considered, papers must be received by the submission deadline (see [Important Dates](#important-dates)). The short and long papers review process is double-blind. The authors must anonymize their submissions. 
Submitted papers will be evaluated according to their originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. 
Short and long paper submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. Accepted papers will be indexed in the CEUR workshop proceedings. 

Authors are invited to submit one of the following types of contributions:
* Full Papers 
* Short Papers

Submission will be through Easychair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adverse2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adverse2021).

## Important Dates
